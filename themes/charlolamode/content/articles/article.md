This is my first blog on my website. I am writing blogs for the following reasons:

   - I want to share and improve my knowledge.
   - Improve my writing skills.
   - Have some fun!!
 
Since this is my first blog and it is also the beginning of 2023 I would like to discuss my achievements in 2022 and my plans for 2023:

What I did in 2022:

  -  I was able to work with some really good clients worldwide on Fiverr. 
  -  Found what I really wanted to do. Started learning cybersecurity and reverse engineering.
  -  I understand that my college degree is going to be useless (got to improve on my own).

Goals for 2023:

  - Be better at cybersecurity, reverse engineering, and malware analysis.
  - Get my EJPT
  - Do more CTFs.

I hope I can achieve all these goals. Finally, thanks for reading. I will be posting more technical vlogs and coding related vlogs. Stay tuned and have a nice day :)
